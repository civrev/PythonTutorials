Here I build neural networks and apply them to datasets. 
I also create examples for how the underlying functioning of a neural network works.
Note: You'll need Tensorflow for these

Deep Learning examples:
- activation.py: manual activation functions, forward propagation, multi-layer networks
- adult.py: neural network architecture tuning, online datasets, classification, data preparation
- adult2.py: same as adult.py, except I tried improving the accuracy by converting the nation-origin to scalar using GDP/c data from the world bank dataset
- forward.py: manual forward propagation algorithm
- gradient.py: manual gradient decent with MSE
- iris.py: keras basics, classification
- iris2.py: neural network optimization tuning, classification
- wages.py: keras basics, regression, online datasets

- multilayerNetwork.png: Visual of the same forward propagation but through multiple layers
