Here I build neural networks and apply them to datasets. 
I also create examples for how the underlying functioning of a neural network works.

Deep Learning examples:
- activation.py: manual activation functions, forward propagation, multi-layer networks
- adult.py: neural network architecture tuning, online datasets, classification, data preparation
- forward.py: manual forward propagation algorithm
- gradient.py: manual gradient decent with MSE
- iris.py: keras basics, classification
- iris2.py: neural network optimization tuning, classification
- wages.py: keras basics, regression, online datasets
