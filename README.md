# PythonTutorials
These are python scripts I write myself.
They are either based on some lesson I got, or outright are the products of tutorials I completeled.
I will credit those who's work I learned from wherever I can.
Since I am learning all this stuff as I go, be prepared for excessive comments.

Directories:
- DeepLearning: Anything to do with neural networks that is not reinforcement learning.
- MachineLearning: Models that use more standard statistical methods for data science.
- Packages: Python package development
- Programming: Understanding python programming foundations
- ReinforcementLearning: Models that make learn to make decisions as new data comes in.
