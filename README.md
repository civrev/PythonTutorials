# PythonTutorials
These are python scripts I write myself.
They are either based on some lesson I got, or outright are the products of tutorials I completeled.
I will credit those who's work I learned from wherever I can.
Since I am learning all this stuff as I go, be prepared for excessive comments.

Directories:
- DeepLearning: Anything to do with neural networks that is not reinforcement learning.
- MachineLearning: Models that use more standard statistical methods for data science.
- Packages: Python package development
- Programming: Understanding python programming foundations
- ReinforcementLearning: Models learn based on rewards given for interacting with the environment
- pandas: Working with the powerful pandas package

These areas were not completed sequencially, be sure to check the README.md at the bottom of all these directories just like this one to find the kind of areas you are looking for.
