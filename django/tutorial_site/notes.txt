Creating "projects" in Django is easy

for example, to create the project we are in right now (tutorial_site)
use 
$ django-admin startproject tutorial_site

and it will set up basic directories and files for the site
that will give it basic funcitonality

to check out the site first you have to run the server
NOTE: running this Django lightweight server is only
for development purposes, and it does NOT have any where near the power
to deploy a real website

just run the manage.py script in python3 with a command line argument
of runserver

$ python3 manage.py runserver

NOTE: the functionality inside manage is just redirecting console commands to some other python file

now that the lightweight server is up, it's serving content on your machine
to view it, go to your home IP at the port its serving it on (8000 by default)

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

usually through your favorite web browser

All the server request (such as serving up content to a visitor) will show up in terminal

To create applets inside your project use
$ python3 manage.py startapp polls

this will create all the starting directories you'll need for an applet called "polls"
we will make this app store the results of user's selections from a poll on the website
