This directory has files related to using databases. Right now that is mostly SQL databases. 
It also has data files for creating databases, but the focus of this is on using them in python

Main Files
- sql_basics.py: Using SQLAlchemy, making connections, creating reflection objects

Supporting Files
- census.csv: A csv file, used for demonstrating creating schemas off other files
- census.sqlite: Same as above, but in sqlite (sqlite is a file that is structured to act like an SQL schema)
- employees.sqlite: For exploring SQLite files
- pets.sql: Script to make a simple test DB to get things started
