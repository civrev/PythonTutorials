FaceBook open sourced their Time-Series forecasting library Prophet
it is a very powerful tool for forecasting saled, and is ARIMA based

Install using this guide
https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html

which in turn likely means you'll need to install pystan here
http://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_beginner.html

Go ahead and install some dependencies
$ sudo -H pip install numpy
$ sudo -H pip install cython

Now install pystan
$ sudo -H pip install pystan

Now Prophet is on PyPi so just pip install that too
$ sudo -H pip install fbprophet

Prophet is quite large and will build it's package so expect 5-10 minutes of waiting
for the install to finish

After that you are done!
